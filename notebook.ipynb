    "## 1. Introducción\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Extractive QA\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the fine-tuning of DistilBERT for extractive question-answering using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and preprocessing with sliding windows. Unlike generative approaches that generate text, extractive QA identifies the answer from the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive QA is impacting the field of Web Science by changing how users interact with web content. Browser engines are starting to incorporate QA capabilities that allow direct extraction of relevant answers from web pages, eliminating the need to manually read long documents. Which reduces cognitive load while searching for information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. DistilBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT has been selected instead of models like BERT for computational efficiency reasons: when developing from scratch it is important to value the ability to iterate quickly and run many tests. It is a distilled version that retains 97% of BERT's performance while reducing the number of parameters by 40% and increasing efficiency by 60% **(Sanh et al., 2020)**. This optimization allows the model to be trained more quickly without sacrificing prediction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder-only architectures like BERT excel at answering direct questions, but present limitations with open-ended questions (for these situations that require elaboration, encoder-decoder architectures are more appropriate since they can generate more elaborate responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning consists of adapting a pretrained model to a specific task to improve its performance. In this case, while pretraining provides the model with a general understanding of language, fine-tuning specializes it to identify the start and end positions of answers within a given context, **achieving 77.22% in EM and 85.34% F1 accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "QA systems enable users to ask specific questions about any webpage and receive precise answers extracted from their content. This is especially useful for documents where information must be found quickly. This task also benefits web accessibility by helping users with disabilities navigate complex content. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured in the following phases:\n",
    "- **3. Data Preparation**: SQuAD, preprocessing with sliding windows, maintaining character-to-token alignment and generating token-level labels.\n",
    "- **4. Training**: Fine-tuning DistilBERT to predict answer fragments on 87,735 features in approximately 40.5 minutes.\n",
    "- **5. Evaluation**: Post-processing predictions, feature aggregation, calculating SQuAD metrics.\n",
    "- **6. Performance Analysis**: Demonstration of improvement over the base model on specific questions about class slides."

    "### 3.3 Preprocessing the Training Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing the training data is the most complex part of the process, as long contexts must be managed and labels generated for answer positions. The SQuAD dataset provides answer positions as characters, but the model needs token indices to learn where answers begin and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that many contexts in SQuAD exceed the maximum input length of 320. Instead of truncating and losing information, a sliding window approach is employed; dividing long contexts into overlapping fragments with a stride of 128 tokens. This ensures that if an answer approaches a truncation point, it will appear completely within at least one fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing function must map answer positions to indices within each fragment. This is achieved through offset mappings: a list of tuples `(start_char, end_char)` that shows what character range in the original text each token represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labeling process tokenizes question-context pairs, assigns a null label when answers fall outside the fragments, and otherwise finds the first and last token of the fragment to create the `start_positions` and `end_positions` labels. Additionally, all sequences are padded to the maximum length for efficient batch processing.\n"

    "### 3.4 Preprocessing the Validation Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing the validation set is simpler, as answer labels are not generated, but rather the model predicts them during evaluation. However, information must be preserved to map predictions back to the original examples and extract the answer text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge during evaluation lies in the fact that the model generates predictions at the token level, but the span of the original context needs to be reported. Additionally, when long contexts are split into multiple features, each feature might produce a different prediction, and they must be aggregated to determine the best answer for the original example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to solve this, offset mappings are maintained just as in training, but with a modification: the offsets of question tokens are are set to `None`. This is crucial because during post-processing, there is no access to the `sequence_ids()` method. And in this way, only context tokens are considered when predicting answer spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example IDs from the original dataset are preserved, because sliding windows create multiple features for each example. The `overflow_to_sample_mapping` tracks which original example each feature came from, allowing example IDs to group features together during evaluation. "

    "\n",
    "Evaluation measures how well the fine-tuned model performs on the validation set using the SQuAD metrics. This process is more complex than in classification because numerical predictions are converted into text fragments, considering that multiple features might represent the same original example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy considers the top 20 start and end positions for each feature, evaluates all their valid combinations, and scores each candidate by summing its start and end logits to perform a make ranking (skipping the softmax normalization because calibrated probabilities are not relevant). \n",
    "\n",
    "Answers that are filtered out are those outside the context, with negative length, or longer than the `max_answer_length`. When a long context is split into features, the answer with the highest score is selected; which leverages multiple perspectives on the same context while choosing the single best prediction. If no valid prospects are found for an example, an empty string is returned as the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation uses two complementary metrics. First is exact match (EM), which measures whether the model accurately identifies the context fragment: giving a score of 1 for exact answers and 0 otherwise. And the F1 score, which calculates the harmonic mean of precision between the prediction and the ground-truth. It is more flexible than EM, granting a partial score when there is overlap between the predicted answer and the correct one.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the evaluation results the fine-tuned model achieves an Exact Match score of 77.22% and an F1 score of 85.34% on the validation set after training for three epochs, which represent good performance. The model identifies the precise answer more than one-fifth of the time, and when it doesn't match exactly, there's still substantial overlap with the correct answer (reflected in the high F1 score).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the comparison with the base model in the previous section demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning. This first model has almost random behavior, with very low confidence levels and incoherent answers that extract meaningless fragments. While the fine-tuned model demonstrates:\n",
    "1. Much greater confidence: reflecting more decisive predictions.\n",
    "2. Semantic coherence: the answers are appropriate and complete, such as \"175 billion\" for the number of parameters in GPT-3.\n",
    "3. And generalization capability: the model answers questions about class concepts not present in the dataset, which shows that it has learned general reading comprehension patterns rather than memorizing examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This journey from random behavior to useful and reliable predictions in the same model shows the value of fine-tuning. Even when performed on a small model like DistilBERT. The results validate that a few training epochs are sufficient to adapt pretrained linguistic knowledge to the extractive question-answering task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The precise answer and efficient inference make this fine-tuned model well suited for web science applications**, such as retrieval systems in browser engines. The high accuracy would ensure reliable information extraction from web documents, while its inherent efficiency would allow it to run client side. \n",
    "\n",
    "QA systems integrated in the browser could handle diverse web content across different domains, from technical documentation and academic papers to news articles and e-commerce pages. Accurate answer extraction could improve web navigation and accessibility, benefiting users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities who could avoid navigating complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore two directions: experimenting with larger models such as `bert-base-cased` to evaluate whether they achieve better results; or applying fine-tuning to specific domains to optimize the model for particular content types. Like technical manuals or legal documents. This would improve performance in web applications."
